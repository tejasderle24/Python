# 1. == (Equal), 

print(a == 34)    #Is a is equal to 34 ?

# 2. != (Not Equal), 

print(a != 34)    #Is a is not equal to 34 ?

# 3. > (Greater Than), 

print(a > 34)    #Is a is Greater Than to 34 ?

# 4. < (Less Than), 

print(a < 34)    #Is a is Less Than to 34 ?

# 5. >= (Greater Than or Equal), 

print(a >= 34)    #Is a is Greater Than or equal to 34 ?

# 6. <= (Less Than or Equal).

print(a <= 34)    #Is a is Less Than or equal to 34 ?
