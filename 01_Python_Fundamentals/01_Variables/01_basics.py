# In Python, varibles are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. A varible is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment oprater (=)


name = "Tejas"      # String

# Rules of Defining a varible in Python
    1. Variable name must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore(_).
    2. Theycan conatin letters, number, and underscores.
    3. Variables name are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
    4. Avoid using Pythn keywords (e.g. if, for, while) as Variable names.

    for ex.
        34age = 44 => Invalid because varible cannot start with a number.
        age = 44   => Valid because varible can start with the alphbutes.
        a$$ge = 76 => Invalid because varible cannot contant special charaters expcopt underscore (_)
        _age = 44  => Its also valid because varible can start with the underscore.
